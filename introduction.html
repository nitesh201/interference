                        May 2020 marks the 50th anniversary of the Kent State and Jackson State massacres, which set off a historically large-scale student strike across the nation. With the anniversary as an entry point and frame of reference, Walkout: A Brief History of Student Organizing uses archival material from the Interference Archive collection—posters, buttons, pamphlets, flyers, zines, and more—to examine the broader scope of student movements that both led up to and followed in the wake of May 1970.

                        <pre>     </pre>Though there have been student protests in the United States almost as long as there have been students, it was not until the period after World War II that student movements made critical gains in numbers, and in turn, in power.  In 1947, the G.I. Bill increased the number of students in American colleges to 2.3 million, a 50% increase from pre-war enrollment. The prosperity of the post-war economy allowed even more people to pursue higher education, with the baby boomers further tripling college enrollment in the 1960s. As the number of students with increased spending power grew, American consumerism catered to the new demographic, giving youth expanded clout. The advent of modern youth culture manifested itself via rock and roll, fashion, and student protest, often all three together.

                        <pre>     </pre>At the same time, Black G.I.s who had fought  to promote democracy and erase racism around the world returned to find that they could not realize those ideals at home, thus catalyzing the civil rights movement. The generations of Americans coming of age after WWII looked at the destruction and inequality wrought by the World Wars, Jim Crow, Nuclearization, Cold War détente, colonization, and capitalism and sought a new direction. The modern student protest movement was one of the main avenues to make their voices heard.
